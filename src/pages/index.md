      text: Microsoft 365 is a cloud platform that allows businesses to grow and scale
        with built-in remote work capabilities that are becoming more and more
        essential every day. We can help you put together a plan for making the
        most of the services that are available today while keeping your
        business productive and secure.

      text: Moving from physical servers to the cloud or migrating tenants in
        Microsoft 365 can be a large undertaking. We've migrated Exchange,
        Active Directory, SharePoint, & Teams environments across many different
        platforms and versions, so let us help you get a plan created, started,
        and finished in no time!

      text: Deployment and feedback loops should be as short as possible to keep
        development teams releasing more and better features. By minimizing 3rd
        party tooling and automating deployment pipelines we can ensure that
        development and product teams are productive and can easily track the
        status of bugs and enhancements.

      text: By utilizing a few key services in Azure with low-cost or consumption
        based pricing options and the JAM stack, a website with full Progressive
        Web App capabilities can be hosted in Azure for less than $1 per month.
        We have starting templates for weddings, blogs, event pages and more!

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
